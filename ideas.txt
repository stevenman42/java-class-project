ideas for the project:


puzzles:

light game (the one on a 3x3 grid and you're trying to get all the lights to one color)
---i already made this one on my calculator. it will take almost no time

tic tac toe (but the trick is that you can go outside the grid)
---what about that tictactoeception? (also somewhat simple though)

game where you have to slide blocks around to get a specific block outside of the box
---(i kinda hated those games)

sliding tiles game
---elaborate?



top down dungeon game? (kinda like binding of isaac?)


rip-off: 
		pokemon
		pacman
		frogger
